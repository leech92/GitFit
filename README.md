GitFit is a next generation fitness site that will revolutionize your life. When you choose to create an account on this site, you have taken one step closer to being a fitness GOD. Users are able to create their own workout plans that consists for various exercises as well as creating meal plans that others can see. There is also a buddy system in place that enables users to keep track (or follow) what others have as their workout or meal plans.

Finally, a next generation site would not be complete without allowing users to find a gym near them. Thus, we have graciously added the google maps API to help users find nearby gyms.
